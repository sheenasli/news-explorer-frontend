## About the project

'News Explorer' is a full-stack application. It offers a service where users can search for news articles from various sources and save them to their profiles.

## Features

### The website has two main features:

- When the user enters a keyword in the search bar, the website sends a request to the NewsAPI service, and finds all the relevant articles over the last week, and displays a list of cards for each of them
- A special section of the website displays all articles saved by the user

### Front-end of the website consists of two pages:

- Main page with a search box
- Page with saved news items where all liked materials are displayed
- CRA used to create template for front-end

### Back-end implementation:

- Calls to external API (NewsAPI) returns JSON data containing headlines, bylines, and other data from keyword searches
- Custom API for user authentication and saving articles
